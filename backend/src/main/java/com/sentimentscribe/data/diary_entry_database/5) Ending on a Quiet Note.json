    "text": "By the end of the day, I felt drained, so I let myself slow down. I dimmed the lights, put on some soft background music, and just tried to unwind. I organized a few things around my room and wrote down some thoughts I didn\u2019t want to forget. It wasn\u2019t an exciting evening, but it helped me reset. I think I\u2019m starting to realize that ending the day quietly\u2014without screens blasting in my face or rushing around and actually makes a big difference. I\u2019m going to try to make this a habit.",
